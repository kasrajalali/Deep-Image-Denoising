# Deep-Image-Denoising


Trained a deep neural network to denoise images of varying levels of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Added noise to images from the CelebA dataset. Some example images that show the Noisy image, the denoised image, and the ground truth image are provided above. In addition I have attached weights for the model in case you want to test the model. The weights attached above have been trained to denoise images with AWGN with Ïƒ = 10. Some examples:
